					Assessments
Start early!
Whatever type of assessment you have looming it is always a good idea to start early

Remove distractions

Whilst Netflix and Facebook are staples in most university students’ lives it is important to know when you are getting too absorbed in what you are watching or looking at, that you are no longer concentrating on your work.

Plan ahead
To make things easier on yourself it is always easier to plan ahead and get everything you need done than try and wing it

Make it interesting
Not every topic you get assigned to work on will be interesting, but there are ways to make it interesting. For instance, find a particular element of the subject that you enjoy and start by focusing on that topic.

Organise your study space
As the saying goes, a tidy room a tidy mind. You’re not going to be able to focus on your work if your study space is covered in magazines, books, and all sorts of random items.



Study with friends
Studying with friends always makes assignments and revision seem a little less daunting. With other people around you working on their own assignments it puts you in the right frame of mind to begin tackling your work.


Take regular breaks
When studying, it’s important to concentrate and get a lot done but you also don’t want to study for too long. Studying makes your brain get fatigued and after a while it needs a rest

Don’t be afraid to ask for help
Don’t be afraid to ask for help! It is never anything to be embarrassed about or nervous to do, as everyone will be struggling with something at some point and need help.


Snack on “brain food” and drink water!

Vegetables, fruit, peanut butter and coffee. These are four of the best foods to eat and drink when studying. 


Reward yourself

Don’t forget to reward yourself for your efforts! After a grueling assignment is completed make sure you do something to reward your hard work, such as spending time with friends, going to the cinema, or even having the luxury of just doing nothing.
