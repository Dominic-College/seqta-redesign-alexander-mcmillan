				<h2>Organisation</h2>
				<p>
					The most important factor in dealing with homework is being organised. If you create a plan to complete your work, you will almost never get overwhelmed. Something that can be very helpful is using a wall or desk planner. You can write in the due dates of all of your homework and look at it whenever you are confused. When you complete a task, you can cross it off the planner and feel a sense of accomplishment.
